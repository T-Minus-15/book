== Work Item State Definitions

Every work item in your backlog follows a journey – from the initial spark of an idea to its final destination in production. But not all journeys are the same. A Feature needs careful preparation and design before engineering begins. An Epic requires validation of business hypotheses before committing resources. A Bug just needs someone to fix it.

This appendix provides the detailed state definitions for each work item type. Think of these as the flight manual for your team's workflow. Each state has clear entry criteria (what must be true before entering), a definition of done (what must be complete before leaving), and who's responsible for the work.

Use these definitions to eliminate ambiguity in your process. When everyone knows exactly what "Design" means for a Feature versus what "Validation" means for an Epic, your team can focus on doing the work instead of debating what the work means.

=== Feature States

Features are the building blocks of your product – significant pieces of functionality that deliver value to users. They require careful orchestration across multiple disciplines.

=== Using These Definitions

These state definitions aren't just documentation – they're tools for eliminating waste and confusion in your process. Here's how to put them to work:

1. **During Planning**: Use entry criteria to ensure work is ready before committing to it
2. **During Standups**: Reference the Definition of Done to assess true progress
3. **During Retrospectives**: Identify where work gets stuck between states
4. **For New Team Members**: Provide clear expectations for each type of work
5. **For Metrics**: Measure cycle time between states to find bottlenecks

Remember: states should enable flow, not create bureaucracy. If a state isn't adding value, question whether you need it. The goal is clarity and momentum, not process for process's sake.
