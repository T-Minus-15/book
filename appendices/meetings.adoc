== Meetings

=== General Meeting Guidelines

==== Core Principles

All meetings follow the principles of **Nemawashi** (consensus building) and require:

* **Cameras On**: All participants must have cameras enabled for every meeting
* **Online First**: Meetings are conducted online to accommodate our geographically dispersed team
* **AI Meeting Notes**: Use AI to generate meeting notes rather than spending time writing up afterwards
* **Real-Time Logging**: Tasks, Questions, Risks, and Issues should be written in the meeting chat DURING the meeting in case what is written is not agreed upon
* **Immediate Documentation**: Important not to leave documentation until after the meeting - because no-one ever does!

==== Meeting Structure

Each meeting includes:

* **Title**: Clear, descriptive meeting name
* **Objective**: Purpose and expected outcomes
* **Frequency**: How often the meeting occurs
* **Duration**: Time allocation
* **Attendees**: Required and optional participants
* **Agenda**: Structured discussion points

=== Daily Stand-Up

**Objective**: To confirm we are on track to deliver the work by the end of the sprint and making daily progress.

**Frequency**: Daily (every morning)

**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Attendees**: 
* Required: All squad members
* Optional: Relevant stakeholders who can help unblock work (we don't worry if they don't attend every one - the best customers attend these!)

**Agenda**:

Review the Sprint board here: [insert link]

For each attendee (please spend a few minutes prior to the meeting noting down the below):

* What I worked on yesterday (have item numbers to hand)
* What I intend to work on today (propose item numbers)
* Any blockers (highlight any items you are blocked on)

We have time for 2 minutes per person and can take a follow-up call for specific issues with relevant team members involved as necessary (such as blockers).

And for testing:

* How many bugs are there (ref: BUGCAP)?
* How many bugs did we close yesterday?

Please ensure timesheets are up-to-date prior to the stand-up: [link to timesheets]
