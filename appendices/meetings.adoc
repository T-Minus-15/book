== Meetings

=== General Meeting Guidelines

All meetings are conducted online due to our geographically dispersed team. Key principles:

* **Cameras on**: All participants must have cameras enabled during meetings
* **Preparation**: Apply Nemawashi principles - key discussions should happen before formal meetings to build consensus
* **AI Meeting Notes**: Use AI to generate meeting notes rather than spending time writing up afterwards
* **Real-time Logging**: Tasks, Questions, Risks, and Issues should be written in the meeting chat DURING the meeting in case what is written is not agreed upon

=== Daily Stand-Up

**Objective:** To confirm we are on track to deliver the work by the end of the sprint and making daily progress.

**Frequency:** Daily (every morning)

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Attendees:**
* *Required:* Squad members (all team members)

**Agenda:**

Review the Sprint board here: [insert link]

For each attendee (please spend a few minutes prior to the meeting noting down the below):

* What I worked on yesterday (have item numbers to hand)
* What I intend to work on today (propose item numbers)
* Any blockers (highlight any items you are blocked on)

We have time for 2 minutes per person and can take a follow-up call for specific issues with relevant team members involved as necessary (such as blockers).

For testing:
* How many bugs are there (ref: BUGCAP)?
* How many bugs did we close yesterday?
